# Squad resume

Find the requested run, or the most recently updated active run in `.workflow/runs/`. Read its `state.json` and `handoff.md`; read `checks.json` only if it exists. Its absence means no gate has run yet, not a broken run. Continue exactly from `next_action` and the recorded phase; do not repeat completed phases.

If the run is blocked, report the blocker and request only the decision needed to unblock it. Preserve `.workflow/` as the source of truth and update the run handoff and state after every phase transition.
